  <h1>MY CURRENT SITUATION</h1>

    <h2>PLEASE READ THIS!</h2>
    <p>
      I dont mean to trouble you, kind soul, but if you could spare even a little, it would mean the world to me. Ive
      fallen on hard times—sleeping under open skies, with hunger as my closest companion. Ive worked when work was
      there, but lately, its been nothing but empty streets and colder nights. Im not asking for much, just enough to
      get a warm meal, maybe a bus ride to a better chance. I know everyone has their own burdens, but if your heart
      feels even a flicker of kindness, Id be forever grateful. Thank you for seeing me.

    <h2>PAYMENT METHODS</h2>
    <p>
      If you feel moved to help, I gratefully accept any form of assistance you’re able to offer. You can contribute
      through cash if that’s easiest, but I also accept mobile payments like M-PESA, for
      convenience—just ask and I’ll gladly share the details. Every bit, no matter how small, goes directly toward food,
      shelter, and getting back on my feet. Your kindness truly makes a difference.
